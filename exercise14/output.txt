 Call me Ishmael.
and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then,
I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
There is nothing surprising in this.
If they but knew it,
almost all men in their degree,
some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes,
Right and left,
the streets take you waterward.
Its extreme downtown is the battery,
where that noble mole is washed by waves,
and cooled by breezes,
which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.
Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.
Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip,
and from thence,
by Whitehall,
northward.
What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town,
stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.
nailed to benches,
clinched to desks.
How then is this?
Are the green fields gone?
What do they here?
But look!
here come more crowds,
pacing straight for the water,
and seemingly bound for a dive.
Strange!
No.
They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in.
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.
Inlanders all,
they come from lanes and alleys,
streets and avenues—north,
east,
south,
and west.
Yet here they all unite.
Tell me,
Once more.
Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
Take almost any path you please,
and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,
and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.
There is magic in it.
set his feet a-going,
and he will infallibly lead you to water,
if water there be in all that region.
Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert,
try this experiment,
if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.
Yes,
as every one knows,
meditation and water are wedded for ever.
But here is an artist.
He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
shadiest,
quietest,
most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco.
What is the chief element he employs?
There stand his trees,
each with a hollow trunk,
as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow,
and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.
Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,
reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.
But though the picture lies thus tranced,
yet all were vain,
unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.
Go visit the Prairies in June,
Were Niagara but a cataract of sand,
would you travel your thousand miles to see it?
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee,
upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver,
deliberate whether to buy him a coat,
which he sadly needed,
or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?
Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him,
at some time or other crazy to go to sea?
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger,
did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration,
when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land?
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity,
and own brother of Jove?
Surely all this is not without meaning.
And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus,
who because he could not grasp the tormenting,
mild image he saw in the fountain,
